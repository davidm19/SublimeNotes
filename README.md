# Notes on the Sublime editor (aka the most redundant and unnecessary repository I've ever created)

## Miscellaneous Commads:
### AS OF NOTE: THESE ARE FOR MACOS ONLY! I HAVEN'T DONE LINUX ONES YET

```

	Cmd-p/Cmd-t		Fuzzy find/open files

	Cmd-n			Open a new file in an empty window

	Cmd-M-2			Split window in 2
	Cmd-M-3			Split window in 3
	Cmd-M-4			Split window in 4
	Cmd-M-2			Split window in 4 (but in squares)
	Cmd-M-1			Go back to viewing just one file

	Cmd-d			Sublime's famous multiple cursors (press once and you highlight the current word; each successive press highlights the same word as it is present in the file; to skip, just press Cmd-k and then Cmd-d again)

	C-Cmd-Up/C-Cmd-Up
					Moves current line up and down

	Cmd-[/Cmd-]		Change indentation of current line

	Cmd-k Cmd-b		Hide menubar

```

## Okay look it's not like I'm gonna do more...
